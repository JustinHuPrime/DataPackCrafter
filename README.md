# DataPackCrafter

CPSC 410 Project 1: A Minecraft Datapack Specification Language

## Installation and Usage

This project uses Node.js 14.x. To build it, check out the source and run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then you can start the app using:

```
npm start -- path/to/your/datapack
```

By default, the output datapack will be written to `pack.zip`. You can specify an alternative output path by adding `-o <output_path>` to the command line.

## Using the language

See [`docs/quickstart.md`](`docs/quickstart.md`) for a quick start guide.
